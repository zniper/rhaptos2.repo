"""THis exists solely to provide less typing for a "leaf node" in a
simple realtional schema (1:M and 1:M-N:1) when used with SQLAlchemy

SA does not support class based inheritence in the normal Python way
for objects inheriting from Base.  Thus we have those objects perform
multiple inheritence...

security issues

Discussion

I see each resource (folder, module, collection) as a individual resource
with individually managed permissions.

Each function (GET PUT POST DELETE) should be requested through the API with
a security "thing" (useruri).  This is to try and keep stateless end to end
(ie not have to worry how we are handling sessions from the request point through the
backend)



Security use cases

folder

1. User has RW permission set on Folder F and children C1,C2
