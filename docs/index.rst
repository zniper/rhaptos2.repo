Rhaptos2.Repo - Documentation 
=============================

Welcome to the docs for Rhaptos2.repo.

These docs will need filling out - however a number of the modules 
are internally documented and are laid out below

Misc.
=====

Here are misc notes that need to be better incorporated into the body of the
docs.




1. Concerns over use of <li> in storing data.
   
   We are using textual representations of HTML5 to store a module.
   This means we store the HTML5 of a module as part of a document
   that represents that doc and its associated metadata.

   THis seems to work well.

   We are also storing a collection using HTML5 in the body of the documnet
   - that is the tree structure of a collection is represented in one documnet
   as a seires of <li> nodes.

   Using <li> as nodes is of minor consequence, but there is consequence for
   storing the whole tree in one document.  Let us take for example a collection
   of three levels deep - lets choose the article on penguins in the
   Encycloipaedia Britiannica.  THe collection looks like::

     Britannica
     |
      - P-O
      | 
       - Penguin

    Now if Britannica is a collection (of all the volumes), and stores the whole
    tree within itself, and the P-O is another collection and stores the whole
    tree, we have two trees pointing to Penguion - and they need to be kept in
    synch.

    We basically cannot nest collections and store the whole tree within each
