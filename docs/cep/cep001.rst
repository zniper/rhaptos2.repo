Migrate away from ORM
=====================

ORM's are not simple.  They can be easy. We should long-term aim for simple.

Overview
--------

* Replace the SQLAlchemy ORM with direct SQL calls, mediated by a reliable
  driver (psycopg2).  Ensure the management of calls is simple (ie all stmts
  stored in single file etc etc)

* Migrate to using Postgres' new JSON abilities including as a key-value store.
